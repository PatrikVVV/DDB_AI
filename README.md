## Content of the repository

This repository contains three folders:

1. presentation. This folder contains the presentations used for the practical sessions. These presentations aim to introduce the students to the most important best practices for industry-grade machine learning projects.
2. forecasting_case_study.  This folder contains a (set of) jupyter notebooks to illustrate an end-to-end machine learning analysis for the problem of forecasting energy usage of households, as measured by smart meters. It illustrates the fundamental techniques to deal with forecasting problems as regression problems. Note that the code in this folder is essentially just a refactoring into jupyter notebooks of the proper machine learning pipeline at https://github.com/riccardopinosio/DDB_smart_meters_case_study
3. credit_risk_case_study. This folder contains a (set of) jupyter notebooks to illustrate an end-to-end machine learning analysis for the problem of predicting default on credit card debt. It illustrates the fundamental techniques to deal with a classification problem.
4. dataset. This folder contains the dataset for the credit risk case study, originally available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#. The dataset for the forecasting case study can be retrieved at https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london
